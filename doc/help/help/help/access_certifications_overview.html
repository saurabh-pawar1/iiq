IdentityIQ collects fine-grained access or entitlement data and formats the information into reports, which are sent to the appropriate reviewers as access reviews. Certifications consist of multiple access reviews. For example, you can schedule a Manager Certification with individual access reviews that require approvers to take action. System Administrators and Certification Administrators can take action on all access review items whether they own them or not.</div><div id="ww1669523" class="BodyLevel1">You can annotate each report with descriptive business language that highlights changes, flags anomalies and highlights where violations appear. These reports enable reviewers to: </div><div id="ww1673639" class="BulletLevel1"><span class="WebWorks_Number" style="width: 10.8pt"><span class="Bold">•	</span></span>Approve access for identities</div><div id="ww1673643" class="BulletLevel1"><span class="WebWorks_Number" style="width: 10.8pt"><span class="Bold">•	</span></span>Approve account group permissions and membership</div><div id="ww1673647" class="BulletLevel1"><span class="WebWorks_Number" style="width: 10.8pt"><span class="Bold">•	</span></span>Approve role composition and membership</div><div id="ww1673652" class="BulletLevel1"><span class="WebWorks_Number" style="width: 10.8pt"><span class="Bold">•	</span></span>Take corrective actions, such as revoking entitlements that violate policy</div><div id="ww1673675" class="BodyLevel1">Reviewers can forward, reassign, or delegate all or part of an access review to another reviewer. IdentityIQ can be configured to integrate with provisioning providers to automate access management for your implementation. You can configure provisioning providers to communicate user and account information and automatically add or revoke access. IdentityIQ can also be configure to enable automatic remediation for applications associated with direct connectors.</div><div id="ww1687581" class="BodyLevel1">IdentityIQ has processes in place that prevent users from approving or certifying their own access. There are options on the Compliance Manager configuration page and the certification scheduling pages to over write these processes on either a global or individual basis.</div><div id="ww1673162" class="Heading2">Certification Schedules</div><div id="ww1683432" class="BodyLevel1">One-off access reviews can be created from the Identity Risk Score, Identity Search Results, or Policy Violation pages. These one-off access reviews can be created for one or more identities. One-off access reviews are most often used in special situations, such as when an access review is required outside of the normal access review cycle.</div><div id="ww1683451" class="BodyLevel1">Certifications can be configured to run based on events that occur within IdentityIQ. For example, IdentityIQ can be configured to automatically generate a certification when an identity's manager changes. You can configure the events that trigger the certifications to meet the needs of your enterprise. After a certification is launched, only specific items within the certification can be modified. The items that can be modified depend upon actions that were taken on the access reviews contained within the certification and the current phase of the certification.</div><div id="ww1689044" class="BodyLevel1">See <a href="../help/schedule_access_certifications.19.3.html#ww3091668" title="Certification Schedules Tab">Certification Schedules Tab</a> for information on creating a certification campaign.</div><div id="ww1683481" class="BodyLevel1">Periodic certifications are scheduled to run on a periodic basis, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annually. These periodic access reviews provide a snapshot view of the identities, roles, and account groups (application object types) within your enterprise. Periodic certifications focus on the frequency at which entire entities (identities, roles, account groups) must be certified.</div><div id="ww1683494" class="BodyLevel1">Periodic certifications are not complete until all access reviews contained within the certification are complete. An access review is not complete until all items, such as roles, entitlements, violations, and application objects, are acted upon and those decision are confirmed by the user to whom that access review was assigned.</div><div id="ww1683507" class="BodyLevel1">Periodic certifications can be created using a multi-level sign-off structure which enables multiple certifiers to review access reviews before they are considered complete. For example, a certification can be created for the direct reports of a business manager who knows his employees, but is not familiar with their accounts and permissions on each application. When the business manager makes his decisions and signs off on the access review, it can be forwarded to the owner of an application to which the employees have access and they can review the decisions and make changes if necessary. </div><div id="ww1673714" class="Heading2">Certification Types and Phases</div><div id="ww1683583" class="BodyLevel1">IdentityIQ provides the following certification types:</div><div id="ww1686751" class="BulletLevel1"><span class="WebWorks_Number" style="width: 10.8pt"><span class="Bold">•	</span></span><span class="Bold">Targeted Certifications</span> — certify role, entitlement, and account access for a narrowly defined set of your users.</div><div id="ww1683711" class="BulletLevel1"><span class="WebWorks_Number" style="width: 10.8pt"><span class="Bold">•	</span></span><span class="Bold">Manager Certifications</span> — certify that your direct reports have the entitlements they need to do their job and only the entitlements they need to do their job.</div><div id="ww1683718" class="BulletLevel1"><span class="WebWorks_Number" style="width: 10.8pt"><span class="Bold">•	</span></span><span class="Bold">Application Owner Certifications</span> — certify that all identities accessing applications for which you are responsible have the proper entitlements.</div><div id="ww1683725" class="BulletLevel1"><span class="WebWorks_Number" style="width: 10.8pt"><span class="Bold">•	</span></span><span class="Bold">Entitlement Owner Certifications</span> — certify that all identities accessing entitlements for which you are responsible are correct.</div><div id="ww1683732" class="BulletLevel1"><span class="WebWorks_Number" style="width: 10.8pt"><span class="Bold">•	</span></span><span class="Bold">Advanced Certifications</span> — certify that all identities included in the population associated with that Advanced Certification have the correct entitlements and roles.</div><div id="ww1683739" class="BulletLevel1"><span class="WebWorks_Number" style="width: 10.8pt"><span class="Bold">•	</span></span><span class="Bold">Account Group Certifications</span> — certify that account groups /application objects for which you are responsible have the proper permissions or the proper group membership.

During this phase, changes can be made to decisions as frequently as required. You can sign off on a periodic certification in the active stage if no roles or entitlements were revoked or if the challenge period is not active. When you sign off on a periodic certification it enters the end phase or the revocation phase.

When the challenge phase begins, a work item and email are sent to each user affected by a revocation decision. The notifications contain the details of the revocation request and any comments added by the requestor. The affected user has the duration of the challenge period to accept the loss of access or challenge that decision.</div><div id="ww1689056" class="BodyLevel2">Email notifications sent to non-IdentityIQ users contain a link to a user portal which enables them to enter a revocation challenge as if they were logged into the product.

When the revocation phase is entered, revocation is done automatically, if your provisioning provider is configured for automatic revocation, your implementation is configured to work with a help desk solution and a help ticket is generated, or you manually use a work request assigned to IdentityIQ the revocation phase is entered when a periodic certification is signed off or the active and challenge phases have ended. <br /><br />Revocation activity is monitored to ensure that inappropriate access to roles and entitlements is revoked in a timely manner. Revocation completion status is updated at an interval specified during the deployment of IdentityIQ. By default this is performed daily.

For example, a separation of duties policy may disallow one person from requesting and approving purchase orders or an activity policy might disallow a user with the Human Resource role from updating the payroll application.</div><div id="ww1683955" class="BodyLevel1">The Policy Violations are any violations of policy for an identity. You must take action on these violations before a certification is complete. If the policy with which a violation is associated is removed before the violation is acted on in the certification, some policy information might not be available.</div><div id="ww1683959" class="BodyLevel1">Policy violations can also be viewed and acted upon from the Policy Violations page or as part of another access review. Decisions made on a violation from another page are displayed below the summary information within the access review or within the revocation dialog.</div><div id="ww1683979" class="BodyLevel1"><span class="Bold">Roles</span> are made up of roles and profiles and are defined within IdentityIQ. Profiles are collections of entitlements on one specific application in the business model. An Entitlement is either a specific value for an account attribute, such as group membership, or a permission.</div><div id="ww1683983" class="BodyLevel1">Only the top-level roles are displayed in the roles section. For example, if a role contains required and permitted roles, only the top-level role is displayed and the required and permitted roles are certified as part of that role. Both assigned and detected roles are displayed in the roles section. Different role types are indicated with different icons and you can click the role name to expand the role information and view the role details and hierarchy.</div><div id="ww1683987" class="BodyLevel1">If an identity has a role assigned to it multiple times, that role is displayed multiple times and each one must be reviewed and acted on individually.</div><div id="ww1683994" class="BodyLevel1"><span class="Bold">Entitlements</span> are all entitlements to which the identity has access but that are not included as part of a role to which they have access. If the access review was scheduled with the IdentityIQ capabilities and scope included, these appear as additional entitlements on the IdentityIQ application as Capabilities and Authorized Scopes attributes. Revoking these entitlements has auto-remediation enabled by default. This means that when the revocation is processed (either when the access review is signed or immediately, based on the access review configuration) the capabilities and authorized scopes are removed from the identity.</div><div id="ww1689068" class="BodyLevel1">For addition information see Access Review Pages.</div><noscript><div id="noscript_warning">This site works best with JavaScript enabled</div></noscript><footer><!-- Related Topics --><!--                --><!-- Disqus --><!--        --><!-- Google Translation --><!--                    --><div class="ww_skin_page_globalization"><div id="google_translate_element">&nbsp;</div><script><!--
